## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a scalable web application using Laravel to streamline data management for non-profits. Itâ€™s been a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m enjoying the process of tackling new challenges as they come up.
  
-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about optimizing Laravel applications and diving deeper into advanced Eloquent relationships and API development. There's always something new to discover, and Iâ€™m constantly amazed at how versatile Laravel can be.

-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I can both contribute and learn, especially those that involve Laravel, API integration, or enhancing user experience. I love working with others who share a passion for coding and creative problem-solving.

-ðŸ“« How to reach me: email: najwaafrizal@example.comâ€”Iâ€™m always open to connecting and learning from others!

-ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
